		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>Welcome to the Canvas API Webpage. In this webpage, you can view your courses, assignments, announcements,
		and other course information. The purpose of this webpage is to offer similar functionality to what the Canvas UI currently offers
		but with increased functionality and more accessibility. In order to use this webpage, you will need to create and use an API token 
		that you can get directly from your Canvas profile. The instructions will be listed down below.
		</p>
		<h1>How to Get Your Token</h1>
		<p>First, you will need to login to Canvas, click "Account" on the left banner, and then click "Settings."</p>
		<img class="Account" src="../Images/Token_Screenshots/Account_Screenshot.png"></img>
		<p>In the "Settings" page, locate the section called "Approved Integrations" and click on the "+ New Access Token" button.</p>
		<img class="Token" src="../Images/Token_Screenshots/New_Token_Button3.png"></img>
		<p>A Window should pop up allowing you to name the purpose of the token, and when you wish for the token to expire.
		You can name the purpose anything you would like, and you can have the token never expire by leaving the "Expires" field blank.
